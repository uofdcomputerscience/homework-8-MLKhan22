U of D Mobile Development Homework 8

This is either the easiest or most difficult homework yet.

For this homework assignment, I need you to describe your intended final project to me. Include any intended data sources, sketches, and ask questions if needed.

Final Project Idea:

An app that can separate audio sources into separate tracks.
Ideally, I would like to try and separate songs into the
individual instruments or vocals used, allowing a user 
to select which parts they want to be played so that 
they can play along to something like a backing track.
Hopefully, I will be able to make use of CoreML in
order to implement this.

Audio Datasets for training a model:

After doing some searching, these seem like things that describe what I'm trying to do:
